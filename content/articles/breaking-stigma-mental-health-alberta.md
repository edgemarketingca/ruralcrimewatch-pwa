Despite efforts to bring light to mental health issues, it is still something that is dusted off or looked down upon. Many of us and our neighbours silently battle with mental health issues. By age 40, about 50% of the population will have or have had a mental illness.

The weight of everyday stresses, debt, global events and other factors can be too much. It is important to not only build a safe space for people dealing with their mental health but to also let them know help is available.

In this blog, we will be addressing just some of the contributing factors to poor mental health, how to remove stigmas, and sharing mental health resources. So, let’s shed a light on mental health and erase the stigma.

## Understanding Mental Health Issues in Alberta

Every year, 1 in 5 people in Canada will experience mental health problems or illnesses. Mental health is also a significant issue in our own province. Any Albertan at any age can face a mental health or addiction challenge.

Alberta grapples with a significant burden of mental health issues despite it being a beautiful place to live and its other benefits. Mental health is a serious yet often overlooked issue in Alberta. 

In a 2021 report, Alberta's results were the lowest among all provinces, with a -14.7 mental health score. As well, the percentage of hospitalizations of individuals with a mental illness ranges from 5.0% to 12.9%. 

This is why it is more important than ever to help our communities become more accepting of mental health and addiction issues and to build up support networks. 

## Contributing Factors

Many factors contribute to mental health challenges, including genetic predispositions, economic pressures, and societal expectations.

Genetics play a significant role in mental health issues. Studies have shown that certain genetic factors can increase an individual's susceptibility to mental health challenges such as depression, anxiety, and addiction. While genetics alone do not determine an individual's mental health, they can contribute to the likelihood of developing mental health issues. Understanding the role of genetics in mental health can help individuals and loved ones better understand their risk factors and seek appropriate support and treatment.


Societal expectations can also have a considerable impact on mental wellbeing, especially with the rise of social media. These expectations can range from the pressure to succeed academically or professionally, to the demands of gender roles or cultural norms that may be overbearing or exclusionary. These external pressures can lead to feelings of alienation or low self-worth that can then manifest into depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.

Studies consistently show a strong correlation between financial stress and mental health issues. We have to face the pressures of bills, debt and other financial factors. These can all lead to stress and anxiety or exacerbate an existing issue as individuals grapple with providing for themselves and their families. The economic downturn in Alberta has resulted in an increase in mental health issues amongst Albertans, leading to increases in mental health referrals and waitlists for publicly funded services. 

## The Impact of Mental Health Stigmas

The stigma associated with mental health is still prevalent in Alberta. The misunderstanding and discrimination associated with mental illnesses create barriers to finding acceptance in the community. This can lead to individuals feeling ashamed to seek help or speak openly about their mental health issues.

Many mental health illnesses can be treated, however, if individuals do not feel comfortable about seeking help or they are led to believe they don’t have a problem, they are left to live through the burden.

Overcoming the stigma surrounding mental health is crucial to promoting an environment where individuals feel comfortable seeking assistance without judgment.

## Breaking the Stigma

The stigma associated with mental illnesses and addictions prevents 40% of people with anxiety or depression from seeking help. While it takes society as a whole to make the change, we can all start to take the steps to break this stigma. Here are some ways we can all properly approach mental health.

## How You Can Manage Your Mental Health

Everyone has a different journey with mental health, including how it presents, how they view mental health and how they can improve their condition. These are just some ways that you can better manage your mental health.

Community Engagement: Participate in community events and create social groups. There have been studies showing the link between social connections and lower rates of anxiety and depression, higher self-esteem and increased empathy.

Empower Yourself: Access self-help tools and strategies for managing mental well-being, including mindfulness practices and stress management techniques.

Physical Activity and Healthy Choices: There can be a positive impact on your mental health if you take part in physical activities and develop a healthier lifestyle, including adjusting your diet.
 

Managing Debt-Related Challenges: Explore effective strategies for managing financial stress, including budgeting, debt consolidation, and seeking financial counselling services.
 

You Are Not Your Illness: For example, instead of saying, “I’m bipolar,” say, “I have bipolar disorder.”

Seek Professional Help: Health practitioners, counselling services, and addiction supports are available throughout Alberta to help you when you are ready.
