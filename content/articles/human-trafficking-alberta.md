Human trafficking is one of the fastest-growing crimes in Canada. Many of us mistakenly assume that human trafficking isn’t something that happens in rural Alberta, but the truth is, from 2011-2021, the number of police reported cases of human trafficking rose from 2 to 38, and 93% of reported victims are Canadians who are trafficked domestically. A significant number of these cases go unreported. It is a crime that we, as a community, must become more aware of.

Human trafficking involves recruiting, transporting, harbouring, or receiving people through force, coercion, or deception to exploit them. They are sent through trafficking networks within Canada and internationally.

This crime can impact any member of our community, including women, men, trans and non-binary individuals, and children. While the majority of the victims of human trafficking are female, 1 in 4 are male.

In Alberta, there is a notable push to combat human trafficking through awareness campaigns and the collaboration of the government, non-profit agencies, and First Nations.

By understanding human trafficking, we can prevent any more of our neighbours from being victims of this horrible crime.

## Understanding Human Trafficking

Human trafficking is a global problem, including in Alberta, that takes many forms, including sexual exploitation, sex trafficking, forced labour, slavery, and forced marriage.

Trafficking can occur in industries such as agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and domestic work. Victims often have to work long hours for little or no pay as they or their families are threatened.

By educating the public and those in positions of authority, we can all work together to combat human trafficking and support its victims. Through the provided knowledge, we can recognize the signs of trafficking, protect survivors, and hold traffickers accountable.

## Types of Human Trafficking

### Sex Trafficking

There are different types of sex trafficking, including sexual exploitation and forced marriage. Sexual exploitation involves manipulating someone into engaging in commercial sex acts, while forced marriage involves the exploitation of individuals through marriage without their consent.
Often, victims of sex trafficking are forced to:

- provide sexual services
- work in massage parlours
- work in escort agencies or the adult entertainment industry

### Labour Trafficking

Victims of labour trafficking are forced into providing drastically low or unpaid labour in various sectors, often hidden behind legitimate industries. They are caught in this situation through force, fraud, or coercion.

This can also include domestic servitude, where they are made to work as housekeepers or childcare providers with little to no contact with the outside world.

Organ trafficking is another concern where individuals are forced to give up their organs and other parts of their body.

## Recruitment Methods Employed by Traffickers

Human traffickers are expert manipulators who exploit the vulnerabilities of their victims through a variety of recruitment tactics, in particular, grooming. 

Grooming tactics are manipulative strategies employed by traffickers to establish trust, control, and dependency over their victims. These tactics are a gradual process. Understanding grooming tactics is crucial for recognizing potential red flags and preventing human trafficking. Here's a closer look at some common grooming tactics:

1. Building trust and friendship
2. Creating dependency through financial assistance or isolation
3. Exploiting victim’s vulnerabilities
4. Offering false promises and future plans
5. Introducing substances and creating dependencies
6. Coercion and threats
7. Normalizing exploitative behaviours

False job offers are another common ploy used to lure in victims. Traffickers may pose as employers, offering promising positions with attractive benefits. These deceptive job offers often target those who are new to the country, struggling with unemployment or seeking a better life, making them susceptible to traffickers’ tactics.

Exploiting debts are also used by traffickers. The victims are forced into labour to repay a debt they couldn’t repay otherwise.

## Human Trafficking in Alberta

Like any other part of the world, there are difficulties addressing human trafficking and assisting vulnerable communities specific to Alberta.
Victims of human trafficking come from diverse backgrounds and age groups. An estimated 24% of trafficking victims are minors, with homeless youth being particularly vulnerable.

However, certain demographics are more vulnerable to human trafficking; for example, Indigenous people make up over 50% of trafficking victims in Canada. Immigrants and newcomers to Canada are also most likely to become victims of human trafficking.

The Government of Alberta is implementing the 9-point Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking to protect at-risk individuals from being trafficked in Alberta. They are also empowering survivors of trafficking and providing new ways to deal with traffickers. The Protecting Survivors of Human Trafficking Act was enacted on May 12, 2020. This act includes new measures to help address human trafficking and protect survivors.

The Human Trafficking Task Force was also created to find ways to protect and empower survivors of human trafficking. There are human trafficking units assembled across Alberta, including within the RCMP and through ALERT. 

Community organizations and front-line services are also active in preventing the trafficking of persons and supporting those who have escaped.
There are efforts at all levels in Alberta to prevent human trafficking and to support victims. By understanding human trafficking in Alberta, we, too, can help prevent this awful crime.

## Resources for Victims of Human Trafficking

If you or someone you know is the victim of human trafficking, help is available. There are resources for those who are looking to escape trafficking and those who are experiencing long-term physical and psychological impacts.

- Survivors of Human Trafficking
- ACT Alberta
- Canadian Human Trafficking Hotline
- Alberta Council of Women Shelters

Human trafficking is a growing issue in Alberta, where reported cases have increased significantly over the past decade. Understanding human trafficking, such as sex trafficking and labour trafficking, is crucial for recognizing signs and preventing victimization.

By educating the public and those in positions of authority, our communities can contribute to the fight against human trafficking. Recognizing grooming tactics, understanding recruitment methods, and being aware of vulnerable demographics are essential steps in this collective effort. In addition, the availability of resources for victims underscores the importance of support for those looking to escape trafficking and cope with its long-term effects.

Preventing trafficking is a collective action. Let’s work together to prevent crime and protect our vulnerable neighbours.
