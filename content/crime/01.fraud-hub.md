# Stay a Step Ahead of Fraud

Cases of fraud are exploding across Canada, but especially in Alberta. 22% of Albertans have been self-reported victims of fraud. Fraud tactics are becoming more advanced and easier to fall for.  Scammers are posing as figures of authority, such as government agencies and financial institutions, to fool and pressure us into giving away our personal and financial information. They are also online, pretending to be someone else on a dating app or sending phishing emails to our inboxes.

The best way to prevent yourself and those around you from becoming a victim of fraud is through sharing knowledge. You can know what to look for by remaining informed about the latest scams. Programs developed by Alberta Rural Crime Watch, like Wise Owl, keep seniors in particular informed about defending themselves against fraud. Here is some information on the most common scams and how to spot and guard against them.

## Government & Institutional Scams

Navigating the ins and outs of our taxes, government laws, and institutional regulations can be confusing for any lifelong resident of Canada; it can be overwhelming for immigrants to our country. Unfortunately, criminals are taking advantage of this confusion by creating scams to gain access to your personal and financial information. It is essential to stay vigilant and protect your information from these scams.

## Relationship Scams

How we meet and communicate with new friends and romantic partners is changing. While chat groups, dating apps, and other online platforms have made it easier to connect, they have also created another way for scammers to take advantage of you. It is easy for them to mask their appearance, their location and more to trick you into sending them money and your personal information. Remain aware of the relationship scams out there.
