The safety of our community is a priority for Alberta Provincial Rural Crime Watch. With the increase in crime across the province, we, along with our partners, want to provide our neighbours with the resources to stay safe. Through initiatives like Lock It or Lose It, Project Lock Up, and more, a wealth of crime prevention knowledge and support is available.

With criminals targeting your vehicles, homes and equipment, you need to be prepared. The best way to do this is to be prepared and take preventative action. Read more on auto safety, home safety, and horse tack theft. As well as, there is information on how to make an effective incident report and why it is so important for police officers and your community to report any suspicious or criminal activity.
