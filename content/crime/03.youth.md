Children and teens have a lot to deal with. They are exposed to bullying, peer pressure and drugs. Some youths also have to manage their own mental health and thoughts of suicide. It is important for them and the adults in their lives to remain knowledgeable about these issues and how to address them. By knowing how to address bullying, drugs and mental health, you can be better equipped to help them.

The Alberta Provincial Rural Crime Watch and our partners are sharing some resources to help youths and guardians take a stand against bullying, drug use, mental health stigma, and suicide. We are also sharing some signs to be aware of and how to address these issues experienced by pre-teens and teens.
